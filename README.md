# Data Science Challenge Library (DSCL)

Welcome to Data Science Challenge Library

We are a group of students at Georgian College completing our final project for AIDI- Artificial Intelligence Design and Implementation. This project aims to be a curated list of data science and machine learning challenges, created by us. Most of the datasets can be found on kaggle. If not they are linked in the challenge.

This is the backend and frontend source code for the Data Science Challenge Library project.
